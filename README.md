#EtsyDemo

This project is part of my personal practice in learning rails. I bought [this online rails course(https://www.udemy.com/the-startups-guide-to-web-development-with-ruby-on-rails/#/)] to guide me through creating a web application modeled after Etsy. This app will include the ability to create accounts for sellers and buyers where they can create product listings as well as accept and transfer payments through Stripe's API.
